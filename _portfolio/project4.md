This was a really quick project done for a class on my master degree. 
The project consisted in creating a game where the user would learn how to take care of someone or some animal. With this topic in mind, and since I was playing "Magikarp Jump" at the time, I decided to do a game where you would have to take care of a turtle and then put it to race others.
In order to do that a few minigames were crated:
- Feed the turtle;
- Clean the turtle;
- Race;
The player would have to give good food for the turtle to eat and grow. Some food would also make the turtle sick.
The player would also have to clean the turtle from time to time or it would get sick.
The race would then take place and the experience the turtle would gain from eating would influence it's results. If the turtle was sick, it would perform worse.
A shop mechanism to buy items and a friend system was also thought of, in order to make the player more engaged.
