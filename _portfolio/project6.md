My first unity project! On 2015 I started college and decided to investigate a bit about unity and see what i was capable off. And the result was this prototype of a game featuring a slime.
Since at the time I was playing "Binding of Isaac", I've tried to make a dungeon crawler with procedural generated rooms and random placed monsters. In this prototype the player will appear on a random place on the map, be able to move, and kill enemies, it would then be placed a portal at one of the rooms and the player would be teleported to the next level.
This prototype was a nice way to get into Unity and get some knowledge on procedural generated maps.
