My first published game!
Wanting to do something from start to finish on Unity, I decided to do a breakout/arkanoid for Android devices.
The key factor when developing this was to make it so the player would never get the sensation of repetion.
With that in mind I thought of what would make this project different... a level maker that would randonmly generate levels according with certain parameters.
Everytime the player begins the game, he will get a totally different level. The same will happen when the player finishes the level, increasing the difficulty parameters with each level.

You can download the game through <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.JustAnotherGameDev.Celestialnoid" target="_blank" style="color:blue;" rel="external">here</a>
 or just play it on this portfolio!
