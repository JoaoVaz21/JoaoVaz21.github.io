My first Virtual Reality project and first use of the Unreal Engine.
The objective was to creative some kind of training where FARO users could learn how to properly execute the needed worklows with FARO's robots.

For that I designed and developed a VR application on UE4 that consisted on a series of tutorials that demonstrated what the user would have to do and how to properly do it.

In order to achieve that I had to:
- Manage sound quotes;
- Collision dectection;
- Grab and release of game world objects;
- Interaction with User Interface inside of VR world.
- Movement with VR Headset/Controllers;
- Manage lighting;
- Import and manage big and detailed 3d models;
- Work mainly with UE blueprint system (imposed by the company).
