My first game jam project! A few years ago a coleague contacted me to participate in a university game jam. I had never been in a game jam, and never used the technologies mandatory for that game jam: LUA and Pico-8, so I thought it would be a great idea to join :)
In this project we all did a bit of everything, level design, the sprites, and sounds, story writing and the programing itself. 
In the end we decided to make a 2d top-down puzzle game  with two levels that the user would have to traverse and solve the traps and kill snakes, as well as a final boss.
It wasn't a perfect game but everyone that tried it had a lot of fun and it was my first experience in a team creating a game.
